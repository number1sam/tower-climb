# 🐛 Comprehensive Bug Report & Code Review

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** Pre-Testing - Code Review Only
**Severity Levels:** 🔴 Critical | 🟡 Major | 🟢 Minor

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Will Prevent Compilation/Runtime)

### 1. **Missing SupabaseClient Public Fields**
**File:** `SupabaseClient.cs:20-21`
**Issue:** Fields are marked `[SerializeField] private` but need to be publicly editable in Inspector
**Problem:**
```csharp
[SerializeField] private string supabaseUrl = "https://your-project.supabase.co";
[SerializeField] private string supabaseAnonKey = "your-anon-key";
```
Should be:
```csharp
public string supabaseUrl = "https://your-project.supabase.co";
public string supabaseAnonKey = "your-anon-key";
```
**Impact:** Developer cannot set credentials in Unity Inspector
**Fix Required:** Change to public or add getters

---

### 2. **Missing TextMeshPro Package**
**Files:** Multiple UI scripts
**Issue:** All UI scripts use `TMPro` namespace but TextMeshPro might not be imported
**Problem:** Unity won't compile without this package
**Impact:** Entire project won't compile
**Fix Required:**
```
Window > Package Manager > Search "TextMesh Pro" > Install
```

---

### 3. **SessionManager Missing Required References**
**File:** `SessionManager.cs:16`
**Issue:**
```csharp
[Header("References")]
private SupabaseClient supabaseClient;  // Never assigned in Inspector!
```
**Problem:** It tries to get `SupabaseClient.Instance` in Awake, but if SupabaseClient doesn't exist in scene, this will be null
**Impact:** Null reference exceptions when trying to authenticate
**Fix Required:** Add null checks or make it [SerializeField] public

---

### 4. **HomeScreen Missing Required Button References**
**File:** `HomeScreen.cs`
**Issue:** New UI screens added but HomeScreen doesn't link to them:
```csharp
public Button missionsButton;
public Button leaderboardButton;
// Missing: practiceButton, shopButton, settingsButton
```
**Impact:** Can't navigate to Practice, Shop, or Settings screens
**Fix Required:** Add missing button fields and wire them up

---

### 5. **GameStateMachine Never Fires OnRunStarted Event**
**File:** `GameStateMachine.cs`
**Issue:** `AnalyticsIntegration.cs` subscribes to `OnRunStarted` but GameStateMachine never invokes it
**Problem:**
```csharp
// GameStateMachine.cs - Missing:
public event Action OnRunStarted;

// Should be called in InitializeRun():
public void InitializeRun(long seed, int week) {
    // ... existing code
    OnRunStarted?.Invoke();  // MISSING
}
```
**Impact:** Analytics won't track run start
**Fix Required:** Add event invocation

---

## 🟡 MAJOR ISSUES (Will Cause Runtime Errors)

### 6. **State Change Events Missing Parameters**
**File:** `AnalyticsIntegration.cs:105`
**Issue:**
```csharp
gameStateMachine.OnStateChanged += HandleStateChanged;
// But HandleStateChanged expects (GameState oldState, GameState newState)
// While OnStateChanged only provides (GameState newState)
```
**Problem:** Signature mismatch
**Impact:** Event subscription will fail at runtime
**Fix Required:** Change event signature or handler signature

---

### 7. **Missing failCount in RunStats**
**File:** `GameStateMachine.cs:277-287`
**Issue:** `RunStats` has `missCount` but `SessionManager` uses `stats.failCount`
**Problem:**
```csharp
// RunStats doesn't have failCount property
// But other code tries to access it
```
**Impact:** Compilation error when building
**Fix Required:** Add `failCount` property to RunStats or fix references

---

### 8. **Coroutine Return Types**
**File:** `SupabaseClient.cs`, `SessionManager.cs`
**Issue:** Methods return `IEnumerator` but are called without `StartCoroutine()` in some places
**Example:**
```csharp
// SessionManager.cs:60
yield return supabaseClient.SignInAnonymously(...);
// Should be:
yield return StartCoroutine(supabaseClient.SignInAnonymously(...));
```
**Impact:** Coroutines won't execute properly
**Fix Required:** Use StartCoroutine or change return type

---

### 9. **UI Screen Navigation Not Implemented**
**Files:** All UI screens
**Issue:** Buttons call methods like `OnLeaderboardClicked()` but these just log "TODO"
**Problem:**
```csharp
private void OnLeaderboardClicked() {
    Debug.Log("[HomeScreen] Leaderboard clicked");
    // TODO: Show leaderboard screen  // NEVER IMPLEMENTED
}
```
**Impact:** Can't navigate between screens - game is stuck on Home
**Fix Required:** Add actual screen transitions

---

### 10. **Missing Singleton Initialization Order**
**Files:** All Manager classes
**Issue:** Managers depend on each other but initialization order is undefined
**Example:**
```csharp
// SessionManager.Start() tries to access:
gameStateMachine = GameStateMachine.Instance;  // Might be null!
```
**Impact:** Race condition - random null reference errors
**Fix Required:** Use Script Execution Order or defensive coding

---

## 🟢 MINOR ISSUES (Will Work But Sub-Optimal)

### 11. **Memory Leak in Event Subscriptions**
**Files:** Multiple
**Issue:** Some scripts subscribe to events but never unsubscribe
**Example:** `PracticeMode.cs` subscribes but OnDestroy might not be called if object destroyed differently
**Impact:** Minor memory leak over long sessions
**Fix:** Ensure all event subscriptions have matching unsubscribes

---

### 12. **PlayerPrefs Not Initialized**
**Issue:** Code reads from PlayerPrefs that might not exist:
```csharp
int pb = PlayerPrefs.GetInt("PersonalBest", 0);  // OK - has default
```
**Impact:** None - has defaults, but could be clearer
**Fix:** Document which PlayerPrefs keys are used

---

### 13. **No Error Handling for Missing Components**
**Issue:** Scripts assume components exist:
```csharp
if (playButton != null) { ... }  // Good!
// But many places don't check
```
**Impact:** Silent failures if Inspector references not set
**Fix:** Add more null checks or use [RequireComponent]

---

### 14. **Anonymous Auth Endpoint Wrong**
**File:** `SupabaseClient.cs:76`
**Issue:**
```csharp
string url = $"{supabaseUrl}/auth/v1/signup";
string jsonData = "{}"; // Empty JSON for anonymous signup
```
**Problem:** Supabase anonymous signup requires different payload
**Impact:** Authentication will fail
**Fix Required:** Use correct Supabase auth API format

---

### 15. **Pattern Executor Never Used**
**File:** `PatternExecutor.cs` exists but is never instantiated
**Issue:** GameStateMachine generates patterns but no code actually checks input against them
**Impact:** Game won't validate player input
**Fix Required:** Wire up PatternExecutor to GameStateMachine

---

## 🔧 MISSING INTEGRATIONS

### 16. **GameScreen Never Displays Patterns**
**File:** `GameScreen.cs`
**Issue:** Has UI references but never subscribes to GameStateMachine events
**Problem:**
```csharp
// Missing in Start():
gameStateMachine.OnNewPattern += DisplayPattern;
gameStateMachine.OnFloorChanged += UpdateFloorDisplay;
```
**Impact:** UI stays blank during gameplay
**Fix Required:** Subscribe to events and update UI

---

### 17. **InputHandler Not Connected to GameStateMachine**
**Issue:** InputHandler detects input, but nothing calls it or checks results
**Impact:** Player input is ignored
**Fix Required:** GameStateMachine or PatternExecutor should poll InputHandler

---

### 18. **AudioManager/VFXManager Not Integrated**
**Files:** `AudioManager.cs`, `VFXManager.cs` exist but never called
**Impact:** No sound or visual feedback
**Fix Required:** Wire to GameStateMachine events

---

### 19. **MissionsScreen Button Never Added to HomeScreen**
**Issue:** MissionsScreen exists but HomeScreen only has 3 buttons:
```csharp
public Button playButton;
public Button leaderboardButton;
public Button missionsButton;  // Never wired to show MissionsScreen!
```
**Impact:** Can't access missions
**Fix Required:** Add navigation code

---

### 20. **Leaderboard Entry Pooling Missing**
**File:** `LeaderboardScreen.cs`
**Issue:** Creates/destroys entries every refresh - no object pooling
**Impact:** Performance issue with frequent refreshes
**Fix:** Add object pool for entries

---

## 📦 DEPENDENCY ISSUES

### 21. **Unity Version**
**Issue:** Code assumes Unity 2022.3 LTS
**Impact:** Older Unity versions might not have required APIs
**Fix:** Document minimum Unity version

---

### 22. **Missing .NET Feature**
**Issue:** Uses DateTimeOffset which requires .NET 4.x+
**Fix:** Ensure Player Settings > API Compatibility Level = .NET 4.x

---

## 🧪 TESTING GAPS

### 23. **Zero Runtime Testing**
**Issue:** No code has been compiled or executed
**Impact:** Unknown bugs in logic, typos, API mismatches
**Fix:** Open in Unity and fix compilation errors

---

### 24. **No Scene Setup**
**Issue:** No actual Unity scene exists - just instructions
**Impact:** Can't test anything
**Fix:** Build scene following UNITY_SCENE_SETUP.md

---

### 25. **Backend Not Deployed**
**Issue:** Supabase functions haven't been deployed/tested
**Impact:** All API calls will fail
**Fix:** Deploy backend and test endpoints

---

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Do Option C - Iterative Testing:**
1. I'll fix the 5 critical bugs right now
2. You open Unity and try to compile
3. You report actual errors to me
4. I fix those specific errors
5. Repeat until playable
6. THEN worry about AAA polish

**Why?** Because I can theorize bugs forever, but real testing will reveal the actual issues faster.

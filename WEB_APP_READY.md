## 🎉 What I Created

I converted your Unity game into a **standalone web app** - just like Wordle!

**Location:** `/home/sam/Projects/game-app/web-app/`

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `index.html` - Main game page
- ✅ `styles.css` - Clean, modern design
- ✅ `game.js` - Game logic (300+ lines)
- ✅ `prng.js` - Random number generator (same algorithm as Unity/backend)
- ✅ `pattern-generator.js` - Pattern generation (identical to backend)
- ✅ `supabase-client.js` - Backend integration (works offline too)
- ✅ `README.md` - Complete guide
